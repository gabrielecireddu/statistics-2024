        <h2>Observations and Results</h2>
        <p>
            After performing the simulations with varying sample sizes \( n \) and number of samples \( m \), we observe the following:
        </p>
        <h3>Mean of Sampling Averages (\( \overline{X}_{\text{mean}} \)):</h3>
        <p>
            The mean of the sample means (\( \overline{X}_{\text{mean}} \)) closely approximates the theoretical mean (\( \mu \)) of the parent distribution.<br>
            As the number of samples \( m \) increases, \( \overline{X}_{\text{mean}} \) converges to \( \mu \).
        </p>
        <h3>Variance of Sampling Averages (\( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 \)):</h3>
        <p>
            The variance of the sample means is approximately equal to the theoretical variance divided by the sample size (\( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 \approx \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \)).<br>
            Increasing the sample size \( n \) leads to a decrease in \( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 \), demonstrating that sample means become less variable with larger \( n \).
        </p>
        <h2>5. Relationship with the Parent Distribution</h2>
        <strong>Convergence of Means:</strong>
        <p>
            The consistency between \( \overline{X}_{\text{mean}} \) and \( \mu \) illustrates the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample mean converges in probability towards the expected value as the sample size increases.<br>
            With larger \( m \), the distribution of the sampling averages becomes more concentrated around \( \mu \), reflecting increased accuracy.
        </p>
        <strong>Convergence of Variances:</strong>
        <p>
            The relationship \( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \) indicates that the variability of the sampling averages decreases with larger sample sizes.<br>
            This phenomenon is a key aspect of the Central Limit Theorem, which also implies that the distribution of the sampling averages approaches a normal distribution as \( n \) increases, regardless of the parent distribution's shape.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Impact of Increasing Sample Size and Number of Samples</h2>
        <strong>Effect of Increasing \( n \) (Sample Size):</strong>
        <p>
            <em>Reduction in Variance:</em> As \( n \) increases, \( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 \) decreases, leading to a tighter clustering of sample means around \( \mu \).<br>
            <em>Approach to Normality:</em> Larger \( n \) enhances the normality of the sampling distribution of the mean due to the Central Limit Theorem.
        </p>
        <strong>Effect of Increasing \( m \) (Number of Samples):</strong>
        <p>
            <em>Stability of Estimates:</em> A larger \( m \) provides a more reliable estimate of \( \overline{X}_{\text{mean}} \) and \( \sigma_{\overline{X}}^2 \).<br>
            <em>Convergence to Theoretical Values:</em> With more samples, the empirical distribution of sampling averages better approximates the theoretical predictions.
        </p>
        <strong>Combined Effect:</strong>
        <p>
            Increasing both \( n \) and \( m \) results in the distribution of sampling averages closely mirroring the theoretical normal distribution centered at \( \mu \) with variance \( \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \).<br>
            The mean of the sample means and the mean of the variances converge to the parent distribution's mean and the scaled variance, respectively.
